    <h2>What is React? What are its features</h2>

        * React is an open-source front-end JavaScript library that is used for building user interfaces, especially for single-page applications.
        It follows the component based approach for building reusable UI components specially for SPA and it is used for developing interactive view layer of web and mobile application. 
        It is used for handling view layer for web and mobile apps. React was created by Jordan Walke, a software engineer working for Facebook. 
        React was first deployed on Facebook's News Feed in 2011 and on Instagram in 2012.</li><br>    <br>
       <li> It uses VirtualDOM instead of RealDOM considering that RealDOM manipulations are expensive.</li> 
       <li> Supports server-side rendering.</li> 
       <li> Follows Unidirectional data flow or data binding.</li> 
       <li> Uses reusable/composable UI components to develop the view.</li>         <hr> 

 

    <h2>Virtual DOM</h2>

       <li> DOM is a document object model, created by converting HTML CSS and JS Real DOM, which is an object which 
         gets created whenever any React application gets loaded on the screen for the first time.
         whenever React components gets mounted on the screen for the first time. Now when any user makes any changes 
         on the screen like button click because of which the state variable will get updated so in this case the changes
         will not directly go to Real DOM , instead in react we have concept known Virtual DOM. So we are having two 
         virtual doms, one virtual dom gets created at the time of mounting of react component so it is a copy of your 
         real dom. Another virtual dom is the dom which contains the new changes, updated state variables values. 
         Now these two virtual doms will get compared with each other and will check for the new changes. 
         this complete procedure is known as diffing algorithm. Now the new changes will be updated in your Real dom. 
         this procedure is known as Recoinciliation.</li>         <hr> 


    <h2>What is the difference between library and framework in React?</h2>
         
        <li> Library is a set of reusable functions used by computer programme and framework is a piece of code that dictates the architecture of a project , 
        code calls the library but in framework , framework calls the code. in libray we can control the data flow by methods but in framework we dont have any control
        of the data flow framework decides how the dat awill flow that is nothing but frameworks callls the code. and in perfornmance wise react is having higher performance 
        over angular and veu and community support and also react is having the easy learning curve and react is having SPA(Single page application) .</li>         <hr> 

        

    <h2>Class vs Function component</h2>

        <li>Class Component uses the Lifecycle methods where as in functional component have HOOKs</li>
        <li>Functional component are also called stateless component while class component is called statefull component and there is no render function while in functional there is return  </li>
        <li>functional component accepts props as argument but props and state can be accepted in class components</li>
        <li>Functinal Componenrs are easty to read as they have less code but the class components have complex code structure and hard to write.</li>
        <li>In class component we uses the "this " keyword but in functional we dont need the keyword</li>        <hr> 


    <h2>Stateless vs Statefull</h2>

        <li> Stateless component does not hold or manage state While statefu;ll component can hold or manage state, Stateless component are easy to understand but the statefull component it is complex as compared to the stateless components. Stateless component does not work with react lifecycles but whreas statefull work with lifecycle methods. Stateless can not be reused while can be used in case of statefull component.Stateless compnent is also known as functional component. Statefull is known as class component</li>


    <h2>What are the different phases of React components lifecycle?</h2> 
    In ReactJS, every component creation process involves various lifecycle methods. These lifecycle methods are termed as component's lifecycle. These lifecycle methods are not very complicated and called at various points during a component's life. The lifecycle of the component is divided into four phases. They are:
    <br>    <br> 1.	Initial Phase
     2.	Mounting Phase
     3.	Updating Phase
     4.	Unmounting Phase<br>    <br>
     Each phase contains some lifecycle methods that are specific to the particular phase        <hr>
